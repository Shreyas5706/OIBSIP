# 📝 To-Do Planner App

### 🌟 Project Overview
This **To-Do Planner App** is a stylish and responsive task-management web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It allows users to add, edit, mark complete, and delete tasks with smooth animations and dual theme support (🌊 *Ocean Dark* & ☀️ *Light*).

This project was created as part of my **OIBSIP internship tasks** and focuses on building an intuitive, animated, and theme-based productivity app.
